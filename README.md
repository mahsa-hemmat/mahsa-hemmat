## 🧠 What I Build

I build real-world systems at the intersection of machine learning, backend engineering, and security, turning models into reliable, production-ready applications.

My recent work includes:
- 🧬 **Biomedical NLP pipelines** using PubMedBERT + BioMistral-7B with LoRA fine-tuning
- 🎭 **GAN-based facial expression synthesis** (Action Units) for HCI research
- 🔍 **Real vs. AI-generated image detection** using computer vision and clustering
- 🧾 **Fraud detection** with LoRA fine-tuned RoBERTa on financial transaction data
- 🗣️ **Speech Emotion Recognition** using HuBERT Transformers
- 📈 **Time series forecasting** with LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM
